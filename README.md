# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

My motivation for this project was to create a Prework Study Guide Webpage for fellow aspiring developers and bootcampers. The goal is to store data, keep it clear and concise, and use as a cushion to fall back on with all the overloading knowledge that will be coming our way!

I built this project to test my growing knowledge of the following technologies HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Git! It was extremely helpful creating a project to go alongside all the reading material, nothing helps me learn better then diving in and getting that first-hand experience.

If any aspiring developers are like myself and scribble notes on a pad, or type them on their laptop but lack a solid structure, this will solve that problem, you'll have a clean, clear webpage full of relevant notes that you can fall back on and it won't get lost in translation if your hand-writing is as bad as mine!

During this project I learnt how to utilise a developers mindset, computational thinking, agile methodologies and putting the hours of revision into action to build my first project with HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Git. It also solidified how fun it is to code and create something from scratch, I look forward to building upon this and solving more real-world problems!

## Usage

Each section in this webpage contains relevant information about its topic (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Git) If you open the DevTools console you'll see the JavaScript running, it will list the topics we learnt during prework and choose a topic at random for us to study first.

I know that I'll be referring back to it whilst I'm stuck coding and continue adding notes as I progress in this journey to retain that knowledge and reflect upon when required.
